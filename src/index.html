          Bubble Gum robot, or “Bubbles” for short, is from a family of
          track-footed robots that originated from an experiment melding candy
          vending machines with robotics in the early 1980s. Bubbles is a
          favorite of Binaryville, not just because she generously dispenses
          candy, but also because she has one of the more "bubbly"
          personalities of the villagers.
